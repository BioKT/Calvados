# Scripts to run simulations with the Calvados model

This repository contains Python code to run simulations using
the coarse-grained Calvados model by Kresten Lindorff-Larsen 
and co-workers (see [Tesei et al, PNAS, 
2021](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2111696118)). 

Original
code by the authors at the repository for the paper (
